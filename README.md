Welcome to the GitHub Page for this Machine Learning Project which applies several machine learning algorithms for the purposes of applied research in classification of benign and malicious Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). This project was born out of interest and profound need for advanced uses of AI to enhance the field of cybersecurity and internet safety. 

This site is a secondary address after the original website was deprecated due to several deployment and configuration issues. Nikkolas Glover is the current owner of this site and he maintains the functionality and subsequent updates to the site itself, although the research project is considered closed. In future steps, team members have considered deploying a web application to open the utility of the project to the public, but for now, all code  and front end interactivity is private/disabled (respectively). Please contact any of the engineers listed on the site for questions and inquiries about the project. 

Thank you.
